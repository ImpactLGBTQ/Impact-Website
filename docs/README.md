# The Impact LGBTQ+ Group's website

This is the repository for the Impact LGBTQ+ group's website.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create and maintain a website for the LGBTQ+ Group Impact. Its overall design is to be 
mostly static with some dynamic content, along with an access level and authentication system


This repository currently holds the Django backend along with the old frontend which is being replaced by an (as yet incomplete) React frontend (you can find it at [this repo](https://github.com/ImpactLGBTQ/ImpactWebsiteFrontend))


## Contributing
So you want to get involved and help out? Brilliant. There are a few things you need to know before getting started.


### Contributing to the backend (Django)

Firstly you _need_ knowledge of python and [Django](https://django-simple-menu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
(Documentation link). If you already have knowledge of python then learning Django should not be too difficult. 



### Contributing to the frontend (React)
Please see the [frontend repo](https://github.com/ImpactLGBTQ/ImpactWebsiteFrontend) for more information on contributing but knowledge of Javascript and basic knowledge of ReactJS is required.
