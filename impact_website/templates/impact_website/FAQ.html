        <h3>Is it a choice? </h3>
        <p>
Being trans/gay etc. is not a choice, just as being cisgender or heterosexual isn’t a choice.
        </p>

<h3>What shouldn’t I ask a transgender person?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You shouldn’t ask a transgender person what their pervious name was if they decide to change it as it can be
                triggering for the person.</li>
            <li>You shouldn’t ask intimate questions. It is only the business of the transgender person. </li>
            <li>Understand that the transgender person will confide in you about surgery and other issues in their own
                time, if they decide they want to. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is binding? </h3>
        <p>
Binding is done by transgender people in attempt at flattening their chest, using some of the following: chest binder, tape, bandages and KT tape.
<br><br>
            Many people cannot afford the suggested methods of binding (tank chest binder) or are forbidden from doing so by family members who disagree. Therefore they resort to unsafe methods, such as tape or bandages. Unsafe methods can cause severe damage to the flesh and tissue, making future surgeries very difficult or sometimes impossible.
If you discover your child is binding unsafely, or wants to start binding, make sure you provide them with safe methods only recommended by professionals. <!-- TODO: ADD IN A LINK HERE --> TODO: SUCH AS: X
